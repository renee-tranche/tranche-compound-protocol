## compoundProtocol usage

a) deploy JCompound contract and initialize it (address _priceOracle, address _feesCollector, address _tranchesDepl)

b) call setCEtherContract(address payable _cEtherContract) (cETH address) and setCTokenContract(address _erc20Contract, address _cErc20Contract), i.e. DAI and cDAI address, or 0x0(ethers) and cETH address, and so on

c) set jCompound address in jTranchesDeployer contract

c) call addTrancheToProtocol(address _erc20Contract, string memory _nameA, string memory _symbolA, 
            string memory _nameB, string memory _symbolB, uint256 _fixedRpb, uint8 _cTokenDec, uint8 _underlyingDec) to set a new tranche set

Users can now call buy and redeem functions for tranche A & B tokens
